# Caesar Cipher - 🔐

This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest encryption techniques. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## 🧠 How it Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each character by a certain number (called the "shift" or "key").  
For example, with a shift of 3:

- A → D  
- B → E  
- C → F  
... and so on.

It wraps around the alphabet, so:
- X → A  
- Y → B  
- Z → C
